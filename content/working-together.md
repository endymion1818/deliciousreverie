It's great that we're considering working together.

My aim with anyone I work with isn't just to maintain an income stream, clear a backlog, or implement some feature. I continually try to add value to the role I'm in by seeking out ways to suggest improvements in processes, training and communication so that we can all continue to work together effectively.

For this reason, I ask that you meet certain criteria before we work together. Meeting these criteria is more important than any benefit you could otherwise offer me and is often more important than the rewards of the work I do for you, or the money I receive for doing it. So please consider these questions carefully.

I would like to work with you if...

1. **You actively encourage developers at all levels to explore, experiment and sometimes fail** in order to learn and grow. This shows me your company culture encourages, supports and benefits from diversity and fairness.  

2. **Your testing and QA procedure is rigorous and stringent.** This tells me you are realistic about what developers can achieve and what they can’t.  

3. **You collect only the data you need from your user and nothing more**, and you are transparent about that. This tells me you value your users and treat them as they really are - people.  

4. **You don’t launch products or updates until you are confident they are accessible**, pass WCAG2.0 standards, and are at least screen-reader tested. This tells me you try to understand the abilities and situations your users may find themselves in.  

5. **You set performance benchmarks and enforce them.** Developers are held accountable for whether their code has the ability to render on the server wherever possible. That shows that you care about people in less than optimal conditions who might still need to make use of what you have built.

Thank you for taking the time to consider these points that I feel strongly about.

If you're the type of organisation that can, not merely tick these off in one conversation, but are confident you can demonstrate them over the time we work together, I can continue to be confident we'll have a relationship that's mutually beneficial.
