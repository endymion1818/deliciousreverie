## Hi, I'm a frontend designer and developer based in Hertfordshire, UK.

I believe I have a deep understanding of effective, user-centered, goal-oriented design principles. I maintain involvement in UI / UX design including planning, wireframing and high fidelity mockups. I enjoy the freedom of designing / deciding in the browser.


### Thinking Outside the Box Silo

I love working outside the siloed approach so I can make a positive contribution to the project as a whole. Being a developer as well as a designer helps me to build on company culture to improve workflows so that a team can work faster and smarter.


### Development

As a developer I focus mostly on HTML & CSS (SASS) development, presentational Javascript, and creating Wordpress themes. I'm keenly interested in web animations and love tinkering with the CSS Animations API and GSAP Javascript animation library.

### I"m Rebuilding my Portfolio

Okay, so that's not a great bit of content for my portfolio, is it?

I'm in the process of rebuilding my portfolio. It's going to be a bit whizz bang, so <a href="mailto:endymion1818@gmail.com">please email me</a> in the meantime if you want to see some of my design work. Thanks!
