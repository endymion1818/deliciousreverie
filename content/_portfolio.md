Hi, I'm a frontend designer and developer based in London, UK.

I believe I have a deep understanding of effective, user-centered, goal-oriented design principles. I maintain involvement in UI / UX design including planning, wireframing and high fidelity mockups. I enjoy the freedom of designing / deciding in the browser.


Thinking Outside the Box Silo

I love working outside the siloed approach so I can make a positive contribution to the project as a whole. Being a developer as well as a designer helps me to build on company culture to improve workflows so that a team can work faster and smarter.


Development

As a developer I focus mostly on HTML & CSS (SASS) development, presentational Javascript, and creating Wordpress themes. I'm keenly interested in web animations and love tinkering with the CSS Animations API and GSAP Javascript animation library.
