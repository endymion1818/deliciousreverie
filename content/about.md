### Well, since your that interested, here's the whole nine yards:

### Background

I was fascinated by the web from an early age. I came to work in the industry after a stint as a print designer. In fact, [you can still find and purchase my print work across London and beyond](blog/post.php?s=2015-10-16-kardorama "Kardorama postcard print work in my portfolio").

As a web designer, I quickly found a background in [game level design](http://simplici7y.com/items/the-naia-equation "Levels I created for Bungie's game Marathon, way back in the mists of time.") key to comprehending what is required of those who design for the web. I enjoy thinking about projects from the users' perspective, using wireframes, mockups and high-fidelity designs to convey the intention of a design to development teams.

I'm a proponent of designing / deciding in the browser.

### Development focus

I started learning modern development in HTML and CSS because I had some grounding in [table layouts from an earlier life](/blog/post.php?s=2015-02-06-code-really-is-poetry "My first blog entry - first brushes with the Web").

I enjoy wrangling with presentational JavaScript but, like many of us, still feel there's more I should understand about this language. I deliberately stay away from Angular and other front end MV* frameworks because of the limitations these present to keeping the web accessible for all users.

I'm quickly becoming familiar with PHP and am striving to become PSR4 compliant.

### Where I am now

After a stint running my own company, I have been employed at a variety of firms where I am often involved in developing Wordpress themes, managing servers ([with a little help](https://www.supportpro.com/ "Support pro server management specialists")), and organising, supporting and training other developers. I enjoy working to Agile principles.

### Personal

Outside work I'm a bit of a sci-fi loving, bookish fellow. I'm always happy to be reading something by John Keats or F Scott Fitzgerald. My favourite sci fi series is Isaac Asimov's Foundation, my favourite living author is [China Mieville](https://g.co/kgs/UYizu "China Mieville Google search"). I enjoy talking about Chinese culture and really, really enjoy green tea (毛尖 is my favourite but I'm partial to 白毫银针).

I'm married with one son.

### Progression

Hmm, now that's the interesting one isn't it? It's a trait of my [personality type](http://deliciousreverie.co.uk/blog/post.php?s=2016-01-23-on-being-an-advocate "On Being an Advocate on deilciousreverie.co.uk") that I enjoy helping other people achieve their goals. So helping others to learn or improve in some way is something I'm always striving to do.

I'm really interested to see what the web brings us in the next few years, but there are some serious challenges to overcome. I hope we'll be able to talk more about some of these whenever you have the time to chat.
