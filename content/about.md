Delicious Reverie is the personal blog of [Benjamin Read](/about-benjamin-read "recruiters, click here"), a web developer from just outside London, UK.

I called this site "Delicious Reverie" after an expression which occurs in Norman Denny's English translation of Victor Hugo's epic masterpiece _Les Miserables_.

After being reminded of one of his favourite books, a minor charachter, Monsieur Mabeuf, is said to slip "into a delicious reverie", which means that he becomes absorbed in his thoughts and memories in a delightful state of meditation.

Deliciousreverie.co.uk is where I share my delicious reveries&mdash;Pieces of code, ideas and processes that I gather on my career, as well as some personal anecdotes and my love of classical, French, Russian, Chinese and English literature.

I hope you find something that inspires you.
