This is hard to write. Identifying your own core skills is difficult. It becomes more so when you're patently trying to eschew overconfident, bombastic and brash attitudes and behaviour. But doing so is, I believe, crucial to the success of what I do. So I'm grouping this under a couple of subheadings that I hope are useful to you.

## Background

I started off wanting to be a writer and working as a graphic designer before I got really involved in the web. This hasn't hurt my career. Far from that, it's actually helped me express my intentions more clearly and comprehend others' assumptions more readily. I got involved in the web in earnest in about 2011, first of all working freelance and subsequently a number of small - medium sized businesses.

## Technical Skills

I will never be the best developer in the world. That I readily acknowledge. But in my experience I have proved competent enough at the following to hold my own in a development team.

### PHP
My preferred framework is Laravel, but I've also worked with Perch and other systems such as OpenCart. The bulk of my work has been on Wordpress, but I consider that a necessary evil. I can create my own themes, plugins, shortcodes and widgets.

. I have never had the opportunity to do Test Driven Development.

### JavaScript
I enjoy using JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements including SVGs, and implement scroll effects with the usei of such libraries as GreenSock, Waypoints.js and ScrollMagic. I have also used AJAX requests for search functionality and to load page content. Although I have studied React, Backbone and some rudimentary Angular, I have never had the opportunity to use them in a project. 

### HTML & CSS
I maintain the determination to write semantic HTML & maintainable CSS modules using SASS and prefer BEM syntax. I can use Bootstrap and Foundation UI kits with ease but feel that they are bloated, can be harder to maintain and are inappropriate for many of the projects they're used for.

## Holistic Skills
My MBTI personality type is "INFJ" , which means that I can be described as an advocate. 

I'm often found negotiating conversations among my team members and project managers that I hope will help both parties to accomplish more work and feel more fulfilled in their roles.

I have a strong awareness of business objectives and will look for ways to optimise delivery where I find an opportunity to do so. If I notice a skillset is lacking in one of my team mates I'll try to find a way to tactfully, kindly and discreetly, enable them overcome it.

I've had many years' experience at public speaking, I delight in writing well, and also enjoy designing graphics in Sketch, Illustator, Photoshop and similar programs.
