**It's vitally important to have success before you start a project-perhaps the most critical stage to have success. But how far should we go in order to get our clients on board? Should we try to "wow" clients into signoff? Here's why that is a bad idea.**

The balloon rose high in the sky on a wonderfully warm summer's evening. My friend and his fiance watched the ground receding below, and on the horizon the first stars began to appear. Suddenly, a volley of fireworks were set off, delighting them both with a colourful display. The atmosphere seemed at once magical and eternal, one of those moments you think you'll remember forever.

My friend turned towards his fiance and pulled a small box out of his jacket pocket, then got down on one knee. His voice was a little wobbly as he spoke. "Will you marry me?"

The happy couple began to forge their wedding plans together. My friend walked around in a daze most of the time, obviously so enriched by the thought of his happy future to come...

But something totally unexpected happened. They were suddenly no longer dating. What happened? What could have gone wrong?

What became apparent to me later was that she had been previously unsure of her relationship with my friend. But when he proposed to her in such a spectacular way, she had got caught up in the moment and had said "yes" because that had been the only appropriate response she felt she could give in such circumstances. He'd gone to such great efforts, it would be the height of ingratitude to have said "no".

If you had been that woman on that balloon ride, would you have been tempted to do the same thing?

### Caught in a Moment

So you're taking this proposal to your new client. You sit down in the boardroom, a little nervous but trying to hide it. You naturally have done everything in your power to ensure the success of the meeting. What will win over this set of decision makers and stakeholders to invest in your proposal?

I can see why we are so tempted to take in visual designs as deliverables to these early meetings. It's only natural to want to impress ... but there's a danger lurking at this tender stage of the project which could ruin the conclusion, and cause stress and frustration for every team member in between.

Swaying the opinions of stakeholders is vitally important. But I argue there are 2 ways of doing it. We **can** win stakeholders over with demonstration of genuine professionalism, interest in their affairs, and understanding of their business needs.

It doesn't take much for a client to feel let down. Unmet expectations are a slippery slope.

So take time to get to know their assumptions. Ask these kinds of questions:
- Why do you want a site redesign?
- What are your business goals for this project?
- At the end of the project, what would you consider to be successful?

At this stage it's not just the business goals that are important. Depending on the client, it's beneficial to try to train them to see things from their users perspective. Help them to see that their new site is for their users—new and repeat customers. If they are aware of that, if you're an advocate for the user in these meetings, you demonstrate professionalism and help them see that you have business goals in mind.

Deliverables and trust are difficult to negotiate on. But if we avoid "wowing" our clients and instead seek to understand them, the outcome can be much better—for us and for them.
