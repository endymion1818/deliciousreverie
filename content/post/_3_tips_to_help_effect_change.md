**if we perceive change is necessary to the success of our organisation or our projects, how do we convince our colleagues? Here are a few tips and my experiences of how we can effect positive change and gain confidence as developers.**

[Jeffrey Zeldman's talk at An Event Apart Orlando: Special Edition on "Understanding Web Design"](https://vimeo.com/zeldman/zeldman-aea-2014 "Jeffrey Zeldman: Understanding Web Design on Vimeo") has really got me thinking this past month. In it, Zeldman exposes the fact that our bosses and clients don't understand the web, or specifically our roles within that. This is because we don't have the terminology or understanding to explain it either.

Having personally experienced this, I am determined to find ways to change it. Because, as Zeldman rightly says, if we can't explain what we do, how are we going to convince those around us? When our workflows or systems need to change, how do we back up what we're saying?

For the past year, I've been trying to convince the project owner* to change the way we do things to become more user-centric. I tried telling him softly, I tried it straight, I tried getting grumpy about it, I tried to get him to read some articles online.

Nothing worked.

I think it's because I couldn't convey properly to him how it would improve business.

But things have recently begun to change. Here's how it happened.

###Ask Questions and Be Patient

I began this process by questioning one of the designs I had received that had some obvious holes. I asked pointed questions like, if this is clicked, where does it go? Why do they want this page? What do they want users to achieve?

We spent perhaps too long discussing it, but I listened to his explanations as patiently as I could. Not all of them had answers I was satisfied with. But I didn't want perfection, I wanted progress. So I didn't argue with the conclusions he came up with on this occasion.

I trusted that what I had said had struck a chord with him and waited as patiently as I could for that to be processed.

Here is my first point: we need to trust our product owners. They may not always have the same viewpoint as we do, or come to the conclusions we want them to. But they do want the best results. If we trust them, our discussions can be much more open and productive.

On the next project nothing seemed to have changed. I faced similar challenges, and to begin with I felt frustrated that things weren't changing as quickly as I liked.

But this time in a similar discussion, because the groundwork had been laid previously, the product owner more readily recognised my points were valid. This meant I was able to do some guiding towards appropriate conclusions. I posed the questions, let him offer a solution, and if I didn't think the answer was sufficient, I challenged it.

I clearly noted when the designs, which had already been approved by the client, had boxed us into a corner, restricting our options. But I tried to do so kindly, without attributing blame to anyone.

Being blamed just makes people defensive. Without blame, the discussion can be swiftly channeled into coming up with a solution.

Every time I challenged them, I tried to get them to look at the situation from the users' perspective. And because they were starting to look more at the users' perspective, which is exactly what I set out to achieve.

<blockquote><h1>Without blame, the discussion can be swiftly channeled into coming up with a solution.</h1></blockquote>

###Changing Deliverables

On the next project that came in I was asked to develop a site map. I spoke with the account manager separately and suggested that we call it a 'User Journey Map' instead. Then I outlined the business reasons for doing this:

"It'll free us up a lot because we won't be restricted in creating only these pages and with only this structure," I said. This had caused problems for us in the past.

"The client will be able to see what we're trying to do actively guide their potential customers to contact them." This sounds like a good sell.

When the project owner and I met to discuss the project he asked how the site map was coming.

"Can we call it a 'user journey map' instead?" I suggested. I wanted to keep this as low key as possible â€” I knew that if I had said "let's scrap the site map, it's too dated for what we need." I would have lost the battle immediately.

To my surprise, he agreed without a word!

Instead of erasing someone's strongly held opinions in one go, changing things by degrees can help to slow adjust someone's thinking so that they can more easily adopt new concepts.

###Results

Well, I'm much happier as a project manager and developer because I can produce much better solutions for our customers. I also have more confidence that I can continue to refine our organisation's processes in other ways... for example, to have the web team involved at the outset, in meetings with the client, and to scope a project before we design it.

Whoa. These are much bigger changes and will take some getting used to.

But actually, it has just happened. I have recently been involved in discussions with a new client as soon as the project was agreed. And now I'm also responsible for providing wireframes and a "functional spec" (this a soft term I use for what is actually the project scope).

So by being understanding, by not attributing blame, and by slowly building up to more challenging organisational changes, we _can_ effect positive change within our organisations, gain greater freedom to do our jobs to the best of our ability, and to gain confidence as developers.

_* By 'product owner' I mean someone who is responsible for the overall product in terms of understanding what the client wants. The product owner here dictates the overall direction of the project._
