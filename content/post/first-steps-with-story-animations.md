**For a while now I've really enjoyed tinkering with animations as a way to bring a lot more quality to my projects. But as well as providing interactivity, I was curious to explore another way animations can be used in a project: to tell a story.**

I've discovered that animations can really make a project stand out from the competition, and I find myself driven to this field more and more. Partly, I want to do this to showcase what the web is really capable of in difference to other mediums. But, being practical about it, it's also a great way of getting users to stay on your site more and it bememorable.
