**I wrote this poem more than 10 years ago, but I've never published it anywhere. I've always been afraid it's not any good or that it's of not enough interest to warrant any merit ... but that seems to matter less now. Anyway, here it is!**

I wrote it after I read [Andrew Motion's biography of John Keats](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0571172288 "Keats by Andrew Motion on Amazon.co.uk"). I was so moved by the tragic life Keats had and how he'd created some of the world's best poetry despite that.

### To Rome

_It's a rose you've given, and a rose I'll take_<br/>
_As I leave you awash in my wake._<br/>
_Though I travel to distant shores_<br/>
_I'll remember that rose that it was yours._<br/>

_Now it's the third day out to sea_<br/>
_And closer the shores of Napoli_<br/>
_Today I feel a lost cause_<br/>
_Remembering that rose, that it was yours._<br/>

_Never can an absolution be found_<br/>
_This ship of ours has run aground_<br/>
_And climbing the steps to the Piazza's palace_<br/>
_I lift to you a golden chalice:_<br/>

_Not Apollo's goblet, nor Endymion's cup_<br/>
_Only for you would I offer up_<br/>
_The dregs become of this earthly root_<br/>
_That my soul might sprout forth a shoot_<br/>

_And I might live again to see_<br/>
_That rose you gave, you gave to me._<br/><br/>


###_Notes_
I imagined that when he left his lover and former fiance√©, that she gave him a rose. But the fact is, Keats left the country without even saying goodbye to her, despite the deep emotional pain that caused him.

I imagined him drinking a cup to his lover, but wanted to mention that it wasn't a glorious cup of a god like Apollo (Keats never saw himself that way), nor was it Endymion's (who lived forever).

_The dregs become of this earthly root_<br/>
_That my soul might sprout forth a shoot_<br/>

These 2 lines are from the poem _Endymion_, by Keats, and allude to the way his romance with Fanny Brawne made him feel.
