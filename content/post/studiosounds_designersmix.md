I have recently discovered Designer's Mix, an online site containing designer- and coder- friendly soundtracks of awesomeness.

I don't know about you, but there's only certain things I can listen to when I'm coding, and I do get bored of stuff pretty quickly ... but this site has proved to be a great resource:

Visit the site and check out some of the mixes, I especially enjoy anything by [Jonny Delap](https://designers.mx/designers/jonny "Jonny Delap's page on Designers.mx")

If you're struggling to get going this monday (much like myself...) check this one out by Jonny Delap:
