This is hard to write. Identifying your own core skills is difficult.

To begin, let me say that I really love web development. It's my hobby as well as my profession. Outside of work hours I'm often on Twitter, Slack channels or writing, actively discussing industry concerns. I'm on here writing blog posts. Or I'm investigating some new technique or technology that may be hopefully useful to my professional work.

But I do have a family, and when I'm not working they are my priority.

## Background

I started off wanting to be a writer and working as a graphic designer before I got really involved in the web. This background has helped me express my intentions more clearly and comprehend others' assumptions more readily. I got involved in the web in earnest in about 2011, first of all working freelance and subsequently at a number of small - medium sized businesses.

Because of this I'm used to mucking in and doing whatever becomes necessary for the success of the project and the team.

## Technical Experience


### JavaScript
I enjoy functional programming. I have created UI libraries, built apps with connected API sources, and have used a variety of code resources to build single-page web apps. I write unit and integration test and enjoy using TypeScript.

I am increasingly mindful of the amount of JavaScript we send down to and that is parsed by the browser. I have seen clear evidence that the more we can do to move rendering to the server (as much as possible), and being mindful of the external libraries we import, the better our conversion metrics will become.

Having said that, I'm a self-taught developer with no CS degree. If you ask me about bubble sorts, binary trees or other theoretical stuff I will stare blankly at you. I might be able to do those things, but don't expect me to demonstrate degree knowledge when I don't have one.

I've stayed away from mentioning specific technologies and frameworks, but you'll see what I've been working with recently by following the link below:

### HTML & CSS
Even though I often use JavaScript to template my HTML and css-in-js to create my CSS, I build upon the foundations of the Semantic web, using native elements and the CSS cascade to create apps that are intrinsic to the web, not just to JavaScript.

Accessibility and performance continue to be a chief concern of mine. I don't think this will ever change.

## Core Skills
My MBTI personality type is "INFJ" , which means that I can be described as an advocate.

I advocate for those in my team who are less experienced, less able to have a voice, or feel they have less representation. I want to actively help them to grow by helping them to gain access to resources and situations that will help them exceed and achieve their potential.

I have a strong awareness of business objectives and will look for ways to optimise delivery where I find an opportunity to do so.

Writing blog posts and articles for print magazines, contributing to open source projects, and speaking at conferences are some other ways that I can add value to organisations by boosting their reputation. It's something I'd do without the support of my employers, but it's nice when I can talk about the work I do.


## Progression
I want to continue work with my colleagues to create teams that enable and facilitate an environment in which it is safe to take risks, ask questions and fail. I believe this is the only way that teams can become more productive and diverse, and therefore excel in achieving business objectives instead of succumbing to toxic behaviour.

Along with that I want to work more heavily with organisation that solve real world problems  people have. I'm especially keen to promote the open, accessible, free and international platform called the web. I want to work for the benefit of that community in any way I can.
