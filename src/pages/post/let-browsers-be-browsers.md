**I've been hearing a lot of different, seemingly contradictory messages from the industry in recent weeks regarding frontend frameworks and progressive enhancement. I got so frustrated that I started a discussion on Web Freelancers Hub about it. I felt the answers that came back were worth documenting.**

My original post to the group:

So, I'm really confused.

There's been a huge demand for people who can work with Frontend frameworks especially Angular.js in recent months. For a while, it seemed like I was turning down 5 contracts a week that required this skill.. which I'm now learning.

But now the industry seems to be eating is tail & saying this is bad practice because what if users don't have Javascript enabled on their browser (for whatever reason)... and I agree with them.

I'm a bit confused / frustrated with these mixed messages — I really agree with recent posts from [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/9963 "Where to Start? on Adactio.com") and [Aaron Gustaffson](http://alistapart.com/article/interaction-is-an-enhancement "Interaction is an Enhancement on A List Apart") but don't know the best route to take to

a) stay ahead of the game

b) provide the best experience for users.

Anyone else thinking this / have a take on it?

Although there were a few developers who argued that when developing apps, you have to stipulate to users that JS must be enabled, Nick Bramwell was quick to comment in a way that resonated with me: "I’ve been burnt too many times in the past learning things that quickly vanish."

This is one thing that I've been afraid of, since it takes a lot of time to learn frameworks ... and I have a young baby to take care of!

Rachel Andrew mentioned a use case that I don't think we consider enough: "I travel a lot, end up on terrible wifi. At least once per trip I find myself unable to use a site because bits of their JavaScript haven't made it." This is also what motivated [Scott Jehl to write his book "Responsible Responsive Design"](http://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design "Responsible Responsive Design on A Book Apart").

### Browsers Are Browsers

So I guess my position is that there may be certain cases we would justifiably use fronted frameworks to enhance the experience for the user, we shouldn't make it a requirement of our site. Browsers are meant to be used to view and interact with data, and largely cannot be 'exploited' — partly because users need protection from such things.

I guess that if responsive design has taught me one thing, it's that we _can't know_ the conditions under which our site will be served up to someone, and that we shouldn't try to know, or to stipulate conditions unless there is a very good reason for doing so.

I'm grateful to be part of a community that I can go to when issues like this come up. For now, I'm going to stick with what I've learned with regard to fronted frameworks. Perhaps I might start learning server-side (universal, or isomorphic) JavaScript, because I seem to enjoy seeing what's possible with the language.

On the other hand, it seems that my gut feeling is that I need to stick to my principles and not be swayed by lucrative offers that I might receive that could result in a dead end.
