**In September I attended React London meetup at Facebook’s offices near King’s Cross to hear Benjie Gillam, Faraz Khan and Robbie McCorkell talk about GraphQL and css-in-js strategies.**

You'll notice that I've only taken notes from Benie's and Faraz' talks ... Robbies was about a subject which went right over my head.

I'm definitely going to be joining React London for another series of excellent talks in the next few months.

This is a stub from an article I had published on the Indigo Tree website.
