**Deciding what to animate as a designer can be difficult, particularly because everything you do has to be expressed in code. And not everything can be. This post for the Indigo Tree blog aims to help designers identify some things they might like to keep in mind when designing for interactions.**

This is an article I had published on the Indigo Tree website. In it, I discuss some principle factors that designers could consider when designing interactions, even though they might not understand how to code.

There's also a follow up article which gives our designers some ideas for what they could animate on a website project.

You can read the full article here:
