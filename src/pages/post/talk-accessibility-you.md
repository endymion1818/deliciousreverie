**Over a year ago I was invited to give a talk at London dev meetup JS Roundabout on the subject of accessibility. I recently discovered the talk has been put online ...**

I was honoured to present this talk at JS Roundabout, who specifically contacted me on the back of some of my articles about accessibility, especially in the React space.

I don't know about you but I always look back on myself with a critical eye. I talk too fast. I stutter sometimes and lose the thread. But my aim was to motivate and generate enthusiasm, and I think I achieved that. I _hope_ I achieved that.
