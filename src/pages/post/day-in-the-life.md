**Everyone's routines, days and tasks are different. I've decided that documenting what I do on a daily basis in case it's valuable to look back on in the future. Here's a snapshot into my work day.**

In reality, I can't give you exactly what happens each day. There are some specifics which are confidential to the business I work at. Also, no single day is the same, so I have chosen instead to give you a sort of cross-section of my responsibilities, as if they all took place in one day.

## Getting started

During my commute in, I read my personal emails, 90% of which are from email newsletters. I also catch up on my work Slack, as well as my favourite web dev channels, and Twitter.

After a quick breakfast at the office, I open my project, update the master branch, and check out the feature I'm working on currently. This is the most productive part of my day; hardly anyone is in the office and things are relatively quiet! 
 
Two hours later it's time for the standup. After getting updates from the team, it might be time to review our OKR objectives, and probably time to start a release.

## Releasing new code

Once we have appropriate signoffs from QA, design and stakeholders on new work, we promote a version of our site to a repository where the final built files await deployment. We liaise with an internal team as we make some preflight checks to the files before kicking off a release. As soon as it's out, the team swarm onto the site just to ensure that all key journeys can be completed.

Our QA Engineer will then spend some time validating the tickets we've just release are what we expected.

## Project work

Unless I'm implementing a feature (in which case, I'll continue to code), a good chunk of my day is often project work. I'm researching a number of initiatives that impact our team's OKRs, which in turn feed into the tribe and business objectives.

So I spend the next 4 hours (broken by lunch) researching one of those features, arranging demos, speaking to special interest groups that have been formed so that we can be confident that when we choose a new feature, it'll fulfil our needs.

## Internal work

Tthe remaining hours are usually spent on some higher-level thinking. For example, I'm one of the chairs for our internal Frontend Guild. We are currently rethinking how we interact with our audience, stakeholders, and each other. We're doing this by deciding on what our values are, and our definition of quality, so that we can compose and agree on a manifesto that can help the Guild move forward in a unified way.

The manifesto can then inform some situations that arise from working in different teams, such as code reviews, when bootstrapping a new project, and when a team might need help.

## Wrapping up

I'd like to say that I end my day planning the next ... I probably should, however I don't! I'm usually wrapping up with a friendly chat with other members of the team. Then I'm dashing off to catch my train so that I can be back home in time to take care of the kids.
