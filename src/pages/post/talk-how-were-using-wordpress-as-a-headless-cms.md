title: 'Talk: How Were Using WordPress as a Headless CMS'
---
**I'm not a stranger to public speaking. But speaking on a technical subject? To people who are smarter than me? Not something I relish. Yet, I felt I had something to offer the WordPress community, so I volunteered to speak at one of the UK's biggest WordPress meetups, WordCamp London.**

UPDATE: Here's the talk hosted on Wordpress.tv:

Ever since starting my web development career I've wanted to be in the place where I could help other developers out with their development dilemmas. It's taken me a long time to get to this stage, and it's only because of some great help from the following people:

- Chris Geary
- David Hewitt
- Steve Woodall
- Louise Towler

It's thanks to them imparting their knowledge and expertise (and sometimes their time), as well as others, that I have anything that might be considered worthy of sharing.

## The Talk

There's a [full writeup on the Indigo Tree website](https://indigotree.co.uk/how-use-wordpress-headless-cms/). I'll update this post with the video on WordPress TV when it's uploaded there.

My talk covered these main points:

1. What is a headless (or decoupled) CMS
2. Why use WordPress as a headless CMS
3. Tools and process of building a headless site
4. A basic example and some gotchas we found
5. The Future is (probably) headless

[You can find it on the conference website too.](https://2018.london.wordcamp.org/session/how-were-using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/)

## The Slides

Indigo Tree have [kindly published the slides I made here](https://wpheadless.indigotree.co.uk/1). The slides are a case in point, because it's a GatsbyJS site with a WordPress backend! How's that for recursion ha ha!

## The experience

... was terrifying, to say the least! I rattled through it all in less than 30 mins (I had been given 35 minutes), but there were some really great comments & questions from the audience that I found fascinating. I'm currently planning a series of blog posts on some of the questions that were raised.

Overall, even though this kind of thing doesn't come naturally to me, it's a way of creating a dialog with other great people in communities, and gives others a chance to think about new ways of working. And I enjoy that, as well as to think that maybe I'm helping a few people to solve their development dilemmas.
