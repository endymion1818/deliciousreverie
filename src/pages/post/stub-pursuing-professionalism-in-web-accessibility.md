**There’s been a growing amount of talk about making websites more useable to people with disabilities in recent weeks. In this article I wrote for the Indigo Tree blog, I notice how we have been increasingly aware of our role in providing access to the web to a wider range of people and discuss how it’s already helping our clients increase their reach.**

This is an article I had published on the Indigo Tree website. In it, I discuss how accessibility is for everyone, and how we're benefiting our customers by working towards an Accessibility manifesto.

The article is aimed at our existing and potential customers.
